# REACT-WorkSearch-REDUX-APP

## This a React-Redux app that allows users to search for jobs and save them to their profile.
I forked this from an earlier work at a campus app, and still redesigning it to be a job search app.

## Installiation

1. Please run `npm install`
2. create a database called `jobapplication`
2. Please run `npm run start`  - this will seed the server and start the webpack build
3. Open a seperate terminal and `npm run start-server`
